Here’s a README.md text you can use for your Weather App Using API task:


---

🌦️ Weather App Using API

📌 Objective

Build a Python program that shows real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Requests Library

OpenWeatherMap API


🚀 Features

Fetches live weather data for any city.

Displays temperature (°C), country, and weather conditions.

Handles errors gracefully (e.g., wrong city name, network issues).


📖 How It Works

1. User inputs a city name.


2. The program sends an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API.


3. The response (JSON format) is parsed.


4. Weather details are displayed in a clean and readable format.



⚡ Installation & Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.


2. Install dependencies:

pip install requests


3. Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.


4. Replace "your_api_key_here" in the code with your actual API key.


5. Run the script:

python weather_app.py


6. Enter a city name and get the weather details instantly.



📝 Example Output

Enter city name: London
Weather in London, GB:
Temperature: 15°C
Condition: scattered clouds
